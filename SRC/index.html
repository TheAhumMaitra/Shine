      <p>
        Hello, Ahum. It's Ahum here again! Today I created one of my biggest and
        most fantastic projects — "Shine" for my mom on Mother's Day 2025. I love my
        mother. I didn't have money to buy a gift, so I created this lovely website for
        her. Check out the webpage for more information!

      <h2>About Shine</h2>
      <p>
        I created "Shine" for my beloved mother — a heartfelt gift for
        Mother's Day 2025. It's more than just a webpage; it's a piece of my
        love and appreciation. The name "Shine" came to me — maybe randomly, or
        maybe from a song, perhaps the Queen of Tears OST on Spotify.
        Either way, I instantly fell in love with the name and knew it was perfect.
        This website took me around 4 hours (maybe a bit more or less) to build.
        I'm still working on adding more features, even as you read this!
        I used my current web development skills and started building Shine
        around 9:33 PM IST. Feel free to check the source code to see how it was
        made.
